# Multi-player Alpha-Beta Pruning

Korf, 1991, [Multi-player alpha-beta pruning](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~thad/6601-gradAI-fall2015/Korf_Multi-player-Alpha-beta-Pruning.pdf).

In the above paper, you will get a chance to generalize minimax search techniques to games with more than three players. As you'll see, alpha-beta pruning doesn't work quite as effectively in this case as in the general case. Here are a few questions to keep in mind while reading through this paper:

* Why might alphabeta pruning only work well in the two player case?
* How does the size of the search tree change with more than two players?
